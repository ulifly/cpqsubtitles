1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,229
good everyone, i hope you guys have an  amazing day 

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,670
so today i will be  starting a new salesforce certification  series  

3
00:00:07,671 --> 00:00:11,571
that is the CPQ specialist  

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,300
CPQ is a very popular  
certification on salesforce space 

5
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:19,266
it's a  specialized certification 

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,775
that's one of  the reason why you can see the name "CPQ specialist" 

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,269
now the the word CPQ means 

8
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:30,269
Configure 
Price 
Quote

9
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:35,469
now you must be wondering, okay so that's cool, 
that that sounds familiar

10
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,470
but what  the heck is CPQ anyways right  

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,109
so in simple terms, you can, you can  say CPQ is a tool  

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:51,470
for companies to provide accurate pricing  
with any given product configuration scenario  

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:00,559
so  that's in a nutshell, so i'll be talking in details as we go along with the certification 

14
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:07,559
so today  what i'm going to do i wanted to talk  
about the exam guide and and the topics which we're going to cover right

15
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:10,059
so this is just an intoduction round 

16
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:17,670
so  but i i still believe that it's very important 
because i wanted to give you information around the total passing score 

17
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,400
and different things around the  certification  

18
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:28,830
right, so, the first thing i wanted to  mention to you guys

19
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,400
i would highly encourage you to take  this certification 

20
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,789
only after you have some experience with CPQ  

21 
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:40,249
the reason why i'm saying right, CPQ is a specialized certification, right 

22
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:43,390
and, or i would say

23
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,230
if your company demands you to have a CPQ certification because a project is coming  

23
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,355
projects in pipeline  
and so for instance, your company put a tender out

24
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:56,223
and they're expecting some CPQ work 

25
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,354
yeah then i would highly  
encourage you to go for the  certification 

26
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:05,113
but, if you are someone planning to take the certification just for the sake of it

27
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:08,064
i would tell you guys to hold on for some time right 

28
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:13,250
it's good to  have some real life experience with the CPQ 
because you know  

29
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,810
if you don't have a CPQ experience then it it don't make  much sense 

30
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,910
i do have CPQ experience that's the reason why 
i'm going to teach you guys about this certification 

31
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,270
i'm  not an i'm not a 100..  like a super  super expert 

32
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,259
but i have real life practical experience working with CPQ

33
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:37,490
right now,  who can take this certification? right  

34
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,270
so i would say pretty much anyone right  

35
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:49,039
but in saying that, this certification is more applicable for functional consultants  

36
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,210
solution architects 

37
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:58,120
even if you  are  a technical architect you know it's not  a bad certification to have  

38
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:05,249
that being said right if you are someone who are going to focus mostly on the CPQ side of things 

39
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,710
for that person CPQ certification, you know it's going to be very important  

40
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,000
okay now let's look at the exam guide right 

41
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,000
so, the best way to look at the exam  guide, you just go to the trailhead 

42
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,830
and  you'll get all the information, it's  pretty simple right?  

43
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,010
so when you look at the exam guide  

44
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,509
right, so this is a spring 2022 release

45
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,119
so, this is what they expect  

46
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,469
you know talk about  the things which they're going to expect  

47
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:39,229
so before we dive into the exam outline right 

48
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:41,123
let me  

49
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,320
show you something 

50
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,990
so what normally salesforce expects

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,190
of you know, before you go and take the certification 

52
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,550
they expect you  to have  
some knowledge on CPQ right 

54
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,910
what that  means is that they expect you to know  

55
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,229
how to configure bundles 

56
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:59,910
how to  configure code line pricing fields 

57
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,000
and  how to configure a dynamic code template  
using code terms

58
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,729
how to utilize the ordering and contracting process  

59
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,190
and you should know how to manage  

60
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,429
products price books and price book entries 

61
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:20,439
you should have a little bit or quite  
a decent understanding  

62
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:23,539
about native and advanced rules  

63
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,750
you should know how to configure search  

64
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,250
custom actions for product selections configuration

65
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,113
knowledge about CPQ object data model  

66
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:38,713
now if you're thinking that what i'm  saying  

67
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:40,813
sounds like a jargon to you  

68
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:46,100
it's all right don't worry about it right 
i'm gonna cover everything from the start 

69
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,813
so but in saying so right 

70
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,900
i still believe right 

71
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,500
if you have a little  
bit of real life experience with CPQ

72
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,600
it  will  be good for you guys right

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
if you don't, that's fine  

74
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,000
all right so  

75
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,710
they will not test you anything about

76
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,749
apex or visual force page or billing  

77
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:10,230
or CPQ plug in's so 

78
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,469
you know you don't have to worry about it 

79
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:15,070
so i mean salesforce certifications are pretty flexible 

80
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,113
the main intention for them to test you 

81
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,689
is to know whether you  guys can do the job right 

82
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:27,990
obviously the purpose of certification is 
to get to yourself upskilled right  

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,470
that's the way i look at it 

84
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,333
so it will  give you an opportunity 
to learn new things, give you an opportunity to  

85
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,700
you know do something different which  
you haven't done before 

86
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,790
which is  fantastic in my personal opinion 
because i always love to do something new  

87
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,570
and also it's an opportunity to showcase  
to your future employers 

88
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,890
that hey, uh i got the certification 

89
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:53,800
so i'm pretty confident that i can do the job  
around CPQ right, so

90
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,790
okay so kind of the job roles right 

91
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,470
so like i've already mentioned that you  know if you're a technical architect function

92
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,150
architect or consultant, implementation consultants

93
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:13,629
that's most commonly used terminology 
for the job titles 

94
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,950
who, you know for for the people who 
are going to take the  certification 

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,429
because most of the  companies will have consultants right 

96
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,490
in  consulting space you have, often you have functional consultants and technic consultants 

97
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,950
so they are  often called as the functional  implementation consultant or technical  implementation consultant 

98
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,190
so, i mean the term term varies from  companies to companies right, so 


98
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:48,190
just remember this right, you know all of this profiles 
you can see, you can see right, so it's applicable to them 

99
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,349
okay  now let's look at the real meat of the  certification right 

100
00:06:52,549 --> 00:06:56,749
number of questions, obviously 60 multiple choice questions  

101
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:02,549
so the format is pretty much the same like every
other certifications you have taken in salesforce space

102
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:09,430
the passing score is 65%  which is  not too bad  

103
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:17,870
registration fee is 200 usd so, if you fail the certification
you can retake by paying hundred dollars right on the usd

104
00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:20,150
fantastic right  

105
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,990
now um you can take online certification  

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,550
or you can, online in the center, you can take it from home or 
you can take uh you know from a testing center  

107
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:39,629
so that's about the, you know housekeeping stuff when it comes to certification  

108
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,060
so, let's look at the exam outline right 

109 
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:52,110
so, in this like the expected to know CPQ platform 
which is like, which is 23%

110
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,690
which means it's very very important 

111
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:00,470
if you look at other sections, so CPQ platform 
has the highest weightage  

112
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,830
so they expect you to design, configure,  
troubleshoot, pricing rules 

113
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:09,190
using lookup objects and formula fields 
to meet the  business requirement 

114
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,869
which is very basic  and he had very important  

115
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,029
apply understanding of the code calculation sequence 

116
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:21,450
i will talk about it right, when we reach to this, this topic so don't worry about it 

117
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,589
like i said if it sounds jogging to you guys  

118
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:25,870
just don't worry about it for today right  

119
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:33,670
then you need to know how to, to you know demonstrate 
the knowledge about CPQ object data model  

120
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,949
as it relates to data migration right  

121
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:44,790
set up CPQ for localization and multi-currency 
for international customers and users right  

122
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,240
so, i will talk about it right i will cover each and every topic

123
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:58,299
so, that's CPQ platform then you need to know bundle configuration  

124
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,750
17% which is still pretty important  

125
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:08,590
you're given a scenario sort of a bundle structure to meet 
the business requirements, so it's all about the bundles right 

126
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,870
so, we will look into that  

127
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,710
then we have pricing which is very important  

128
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:19,550
so, you know, talk about expect the price outcomes and other stuff  

129
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,990
templates 7% still important

130
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:33,269
product selection, you know search filters and custom actions, pretty important still, right  

131
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:38,670 
order, contracts, amendments, renewals, 15%  
very important  

132
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,350
then you need to know about the products

133
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,350
demonstrate how to set up products, price books  

134
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:49,110
price book entries and approval process right 

135
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,550
so, the expectation is that by the time  

136
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:58,310
you know you clear the certification,
you should be very well aware of all these topics  

137
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,830
if you're not that means that you haven't studied very well right 

138
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,670
so, like  i always say right, take certification 
as an opportunity to learn something new, right  

139
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,430
it's not just to pass or fail, right 

140
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,750
i mean, you might pass, you might fail it doesn't matter 

141
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,609
are you  having fun in the journey? that's important right 

142
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:19,110
and along with the fun, are you learning something new? right 

143
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,110
you know that's the way i look at  it  


144
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:28,120
for me, yes i do understand right, you're investing 200 bucks it's  important to pass the certification

145
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,350
but people do fail right, and if you fail for whatever reason 

146
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:35,430
just take it as a learning opportunity and move on, right  

147
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,509
try again, so that's the way it is  

148
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:44,000
and right so, the topic what we're going  to cover right, so let me show you that  

149
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,350
i'll be teaching on trailhead, 
as you know right, most of the stuffs are covered in trailhead 

150
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,509
and plus i'm going to bring some of the real life experience 
as well so, it's going to be fun right 

151
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:55,670
we're going  to do hands-on we're going to do theory  

152
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,509
so we're going to do some fun stuff together right,
so it's going to be an interesting journey 

153
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:02,750
i'm really looking  forward to you  

154
00:11:03,360 -->  00:11:10,389
okay so, prepare for your salesforce CPQ certification uh sorry specialist credentials  

155
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:15,560 
i have to mention CPQ specialist right, 
because it's a specialist certification

116
00:11:15,910 --> 000:11:21,750
right so overview, we already talked about it, 
so the first part is pretty much knocked off 

117
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,630
so, we are in the sweet spot, right 

118
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,870
then the CPQ platform we can talk about basics 

119
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,670
important features, installation, settings, sorry the package settings  

120
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:42,069
page layouts, object relationship, mapping custom fields between objects  

121
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:45,829
translating salesforce CPQ records 

122
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:49,829
then we talk about bundles, product bundles, right 

123
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:54,710
all this stuff  right, excuse me, pricing information,  

124
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:04,710
product selection, so yeah it's gonna be fun all right, 
i can tell you that CPQ is extremely interesting  

125
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:10,310
it's really exciting topic right, you guys really gonna have fun 

126
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:15,410
and yes it's it can be challenging at time,
but it is really fun

127  
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,670
to, to do stuff in CPQ

128
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,030
just one thing i wanted to tell you guys right, 
i do understand that right

129
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:27,910
you know, i'm giving this certification free, right  

130
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:33,910
so, that's fine because i love to give it back 
to the salesforce community 

131
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,909
in saying so, i do expect you guys to, you know

132
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,670
form a study group or you know read from trailhead 

133
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,470
because just don't assume, that right i'm just making a video 

134
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,430
so you watch my video and you know just go 
and sit in the certification and you'll clear it 

135
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,310
it's not going to happen guys, 
you have to put  your own time, right 

136
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:02,710
you have to spend time to understand, 
you have to read the documentation, you have to do hands-on 

137
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,870
you're right, it's an investment right 
so you have to be proactive  

138
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,990
you can't expect me that right, i'm just gonna make entire video 

139
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,999
and then i'll assume that you guys are pretty sweet to go,
it's it's not gonna happen like that, right  

140
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,009
so you guys have to put your own time and effort 

141
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:24,030
and till you guys don't do it, 
then the certification is going to be very difficult 

142
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,030
i'll be very upfront right  

142

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,710
so, yeah that's that's pretty much i wanted  
to cover in today's episode 

143
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,590
so, tomorrow what we're going to do, 
we're going to start looking at the CPQ basics  

144
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:41,910
so it's going to take us right, roughly around... maybe 15 hours  

145
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,910
right, so we'll see how we go right 

146
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:52,790
so, i don't want to rush right, i wanted to give you guys enough time 
so even in in my previous certification right

147
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,470
the service cloud, you might have seen that  i've been doing quite slow 

148
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,350
the reason why i'm being doing quite slower 

149
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:06,389
because i want you guys to you know
have enough time to read the material 

150
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:10,629
to, to do different things to practice before you you know, 
start working on the next topic  

151
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:17,430
so usually, i would say if you are pretty new to CPQ 
you will need at least three to four months 

152
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,389
at  least a preparation, you cannot clear it  just by doing 15 days 

153
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:24,629
i just hate to break this to you guys  

154
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:29,030
you cannot clear CPQ certification with zero experience in 15 days 

155
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,430
if that's what you are aspiring to be  

156
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,430
it's, i mean, you might pass but what's the point? right  

157
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,949
so i would highly encourage you guys to spend at least two to three months

158
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:40,870
if you are new to CPQ

159
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,790
if you're experienced, if you have a lot of experience then you'll smash it up even in a week

160
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,470
so you don't have to worry much so  

161
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:54,279
yeah so that's pretty much i wanted to  talk about in today's episode 
thank you
