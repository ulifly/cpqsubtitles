1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,650
good everyone i hope you guys 
have an  amazing day

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,450
so what i'm gonna do today i will talk about  

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,750
the package settings 
which comes with the CPQ

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,050
my apologies 

5 
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,700
it's been a while that i've done
any video on CPQ, right 

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,950
the reason being i've been unwell 
for a you know, for a couple of weeks 

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,950
because i've been down with influenza  

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,380
so yeah, so i was not able to talk  

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,360
because my lungs is still healing 

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,500
so in saying that

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,350
i won't be making a very long video today 

12
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,400
so i will do short videos  

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,350
you know over the course of time 

14
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,850
i'm gonna get back to making 
you know longer duration videos 

15
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,000
okay, so when you install CPQ, right 

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,900
if you if you remember 
i talked about in the last episode 

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,600
CPQ you can go to the trial 
and install it, right 

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,050
it's usually for 90 days 

19
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,150
pretty simple 

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,550
now CPQ, when you install CPQ 
typically comes with a few settings

21
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,400
which is worth to know  

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,200
because you tampering with those 

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,850
will have a profound impact the way you

24
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:02,950
work with CPQ 

25
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,700
so, i thought, i investigate, sorry 

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,750
i spent some time
to explain to you guys 

27
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,100
what the settings are about 

28
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,100
we won't be covering  
everything today 

29
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,000
but i will talk about a few, right 

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,650
okay, so i logged into my org  

31
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,050
so i hope you guys have registered for CPQ org 

32
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,450
if you do not know how to do that 

33
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,050
please watch my previous episode 

34
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,450
i talked about it in detail, right 

35
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,850
okay so, under quick find 

36
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,550
i go... installed packages  

37
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,850
all right so you can see 
that CPQ is installed, right  

38
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,850
and it's still active 

39
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,350
and you can see the expiration date 

40
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,000
it's not set which is fine for now 

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
okay so i'm gonna go to configure  

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,150
so we will look at a few settings 

43
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,650
so, documents right 

44
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,550
we got different options  

45
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,000
there now you must be wondering 
oh wow that's a lot of settings 

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
yeah, it comes with a lot of settings

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,450
but it will be good to know 
what the settings are 

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
first start with the document folder, right 

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the first one  

50
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,300
so it contains a few options 

51
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,200
so the document folders 

52
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,200
what that means is that uh it 
lets you select the folder

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,000
which contains the quote document after generation 

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,850
so  you remember i talked about 

55
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,350
i demonstrated last episode 
how to create a quote, right 

56
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,770
so once the quote is generated 
it has to go somewhere, right 

57
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,160
so that's what you set it here 
you can go into quote folder

58
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,200
you can go in under personal documents 

59
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,050
salesforce CPQ assets

60
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,400
SteelBrick CPQ template resources, right 

61
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,050
so that's nothing

62
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,850
attachment target uh so 
you choose target object, right  

63
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,650
so say for instance 

64
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,350
by default is opportunity

65
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,200
so when you choose opportunity 

66
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,650
what happens is the quote documents, right 

67
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,600
which they are usually  saved  

68
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,950
in the chosen salesforce document folder  

69
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,150
and in the opportunity 
notes and attachment related lists 

70
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,900
right, so usually when the quotes get you know 

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,550
generator righ,t so you chose this document folder 

72
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,750
so it goes there 

73
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,950
along with that 

74
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,650
it goes to your opportunity 
related list, right, notes attachment

75
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,500
now, if you decide to choose the quote right  

76
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,900
so you must be wondering okay so 
what that what we'll do what, sorry  

77
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,220
what that will do right, 
if you select quote

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,700
so when you select aquote, right  

79
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,650
the quote documents as usual

80
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,350
they usually saved in the 
chosen salesforce documentation  

81
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,750
along with that 

82
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,600
it also goes into the quotes notes 
and attachment related list  

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,950
it's pretty simple, right  

84
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,650
now if you select document only, so 

85
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,650
it just pretty much only stores 

86
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,150
into the, you know document
folder which you selected

87
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,450
it's pretty simple, right 

88
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,550
now, hide document name  

89
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,800
so if you wanted to hide the file name 

90
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,250
on a quote document you can do that 

91
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,350
so it's usually helpful 
when you if you don't want the 

92
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:01,100
you know the sales team to  
fiddle uh with the document name 

93
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,800
or change it for whatever reason, right  

94
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,560
so usually you know,
it comes with the default name, right  

95
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,750
now if the sales reps right 

96
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,750
they say okay i don't want the 
default name i wanted to change it 

97
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,750
so if you if you tick this one, right 
they will not be able to do that  

98
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,130
right, so that's pretty simple right

99
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,100
post to feed  

100
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,650
so now you must be wondering right 

101
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,550
a few of the options are tick,
yeah that's by default 

102
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,550
uh comes with that, but  

103
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,850
you know the reason why i'm talking about this settings

104
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,850
so that you know you guys understand right 

105
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,000
if you have a business requirement 
where you wanted to implement the CPQ

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,550
you need to know this settings 
so that you can make best use of the CPQ

107
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,900
so uh but just  don't rely on the 
default options that's been given to you, right  

108
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,550
when you install this product  

109
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,200
okay now post to feed 

110
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
as usual the name indicates 
pretty simple 

111
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,440
it posts the quote document the chatter feed  

112
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,750
which is associated with the quote

113
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,100
or opportunity attachment target  

114
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,550
okay so that's pretty much about it  

115
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,565
so full page review, if you can do... preview sorry 

116
00:05:08,565 --> 00:05:10,165
full page preview 

116

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,860
it previews the quote document in a full window 

117
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,980
instead of a small iframe right  

118
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,200 
that's pretty much it  

119
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,050 
as you can see that my voice 
is still not very clear 

120
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,400
my apologies for that 

121
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,900
i mean like i said i'm still recovering so  

122
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,500
it will get better i mean 

123
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,200
i mean if you would have heard me 
a couple of uh you know  

124
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,850
last week i got like a horse voice right  

125
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,400
it just sounded pretty strange 

126
00:05:33,500 --> 0:05:37,350
and i you know one of my co-workers said 
hey you sound like a very different person 

127
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,250
i mean even though i work from home but  
still right when you talk in teams  

128
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,500
so anyways sorry daggers 

129
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,950
okay so enable multi-language translation 

130
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,350
this is pretty interesting though right  

131
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,300
so, what that will do if you tick this option  

132
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,600
uh it will allows the sales rep 
to generate the quote documentation 

133
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,000
in one of your org supported language right  

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,800
your work might support spanish 
you might support italian

135
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,500
much about korean right over right  

136
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,800
so what that will do this will add a locale pick list  

137
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,500
to the generated document page okay  

138
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,900
so, but the but the problem is 

139
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,600
uh not the problem 

140
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,300
but there's something 
which you have to keep into consideration  

141
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,100
you must also have  

142
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,300
translator values stored for 
the language that they can select  

143
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,900
okay so that's that's pretty much it  

144
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,000
okay now, 

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,500
there's something called mass document username 

146
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,500
now you must be wondering oh, this is a click... 

147
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,200
you know request authorization okay 

148
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,300
so, so what does that mean right 
if you click that button  

149
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,000
it will allow salesforce CPQ 

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,900
to generate and send 
quote documents on your behalf  

151
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,600
when you're not logged into the salesforce 

152
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,650
so if you want that functionality
then go for it 

153
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,700
i mean this setting appears only upon
the the first installation okay 

154
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,700
so uh so, if you select this one 

155
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,400
this options goes away, 
so when you select it  

156
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,500
you're just telling the salesforce CPQ hey 

157
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,400
generate the, the quote and 

158
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,200
you know send document on my behalf 
and i'm not logged in so 

159
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,600
if that's your business requirement 
go and select it 

160
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,350
if you tick it,
then you can't roll back 

161
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,150
probably you might have to 
call the support i'm not 100% sure  

162
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,950
um so then we have the 
group package settings, right  

163
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,750
this is... not too much  

164
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,200
in the sense right, 
you don't see much options there 

165
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,800
i mean you need to understand solution groups 

166
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,850
i'll talk about solution group 
in the coming episode 

167
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,750
but just remember for the sake of...  

168
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,120
you know understanding at the stage 

169
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,420
that if you enable this option right 

170
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,000
it will allow admins to create 
solution group for the sales reps 

171
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,100
to use in the code line editor 

172
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,000
yeah like if you see in the quote right 

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,400
so we have a quote and we have 
you know the header  

174
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,850
then we have lines right 

175
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,240
where you add  different stuff to it  

176
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,380
so the solution group  

177
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,200
the you know the functionality 
of solution group in nutshell, right 

178
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,100
it will  let you group 
and subtotal products 

179
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,750
independently of other quote line item  

180
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,100
and the quote line groups  

181
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:23,250
so if your company has a standard set 
of quote line group like  

182
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:29,000
say solar panel hardware or say solar panel software  

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
or you can say solar panel different  stuff 

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,050
if you have a separate lines of grouping 

185
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,800
then this will be handy 
i'll talk about it right  

186
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,950
when i get to this stage just for now  
just just don't worry about it 


187
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,950
just just understand one thing 
you tick this option 


188
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,300
you will allow admin to create  
he you know the the solution group  


189
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,100
for your app okay so that it can 
be used in the uh quote line editor 


190
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,150
simple right, okay now require group name 

191 
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,200
okay this is by default ticked  

192
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,000
um so what happens is, right 

193
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,600
when this  option is ticked  

194
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,100
sales reps are required to... 

195
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,800
so when you  when you tick this 

196
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,600
it will allow the sales rep 
to edit group names 

197
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:11,600
in the quote line editor 

198
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,250
so, so require group names so yeah  

199
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,250
so sales reps are required to edit 

200
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:21,250
group names in the quote line editor, so  

201
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,400
that's um then we have um  

202 
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,500
lime editor package settings 

203
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,350
it's a lot of them 

204
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,450
i understand that  

205
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,550
um so let's see  

206
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,300
we talk about the plugins right 

207
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,500
i'm  gonna talk about  

208
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,450
uh line editor it's a bit complicated 

209
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,000
so i don't want to go too deep into it 

210
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,100
uh just gonna talk about few things right 

211
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,000
uh which is gonna be commonly used 

212
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,450
electronic signature plug-in 
for instance this one  

213
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,550
so what that will do is right 

214
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,000
um it lets you integrate salesforce CPQ

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,260
with electronic e-signature provider 
like for instance kundasign 

216
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,450
if you wanted to 

217
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,900
you know integrate your CPQ with you 
know kundasign, you can do that 

218
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,550
then you have uh you know something called  

219
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,700
product search plugin 

220
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,000
so it lets you modify and add  

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,800
specif uh to uh you know  
specification specification  

222
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,160
i can't pronounce the word  

223
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,550
specificity to product filter searches  

224
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,050
and it will pretty much help you with you know  

225
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,250
the search stuff  

226
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,900
so i haven't used this functionality so much 

227
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,650
so i can't really get into the detail 

228
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,850
but i've used electronic signature a lot 

229
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,800
um then i've used the quote calculator plugin 

230
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,600
that i've used in so you know 

231
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,800
you can extend the  
functionality of the salesforce 

232 
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,570
CPQ calculator  

233
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,800
so you can use it here 
so i've used that one  

234
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,000
but product search plug-in not really so  

235
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,750
i can but this is a functionality there  

236
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,450
so um yeah 

237
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,750
and then the order management 
plug-in is there so which is another  

238
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,250
important stuff then we have just 

239
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,950 
you know so order management plug-in 

240
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,350 
it lets you customize you know sales 
how your salesforce CPQ

250
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,350 
calculate normally the order start date  

251
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,850 
so if you're you know if you wanted to  

252
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,150 
work on your order start date 
so this is the plugin 

253
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,550 
to go for it 

254
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,550 
so that's the order management plugin

255
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,800 
then we have, document store plugin 

256
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,500 
which is, which is another plug-in 
which is i believe very important 

257
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500 
i've seen often integration 
with that plug-in a lot 

257
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,150 
in CPQ based on my experience 
working this CPQ implementation before 

258
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,750 
so it lets you integrate your CPQ with  you know 

259
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,250
document management providers right 
so whichever you choose  

260
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:51,250
so that's.. then we have pricing and calculation  
which is another one  

261
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,150
i will touch a little bit on pricing  and calculation  

262
00:11:56,666 --> 00:12:01,900
so now the first one is the currency symbol right  

263
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,200
now you must be wondering what 
the heck is the currency symbol so

264
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,650
so if you so CPQ right, it uses this currency symbol 

265
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,950
in the quote line editor  

266
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:18,050
on the generated document right 
like a dollar sign or whatever right 

267
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,350
so  that's pretty much it  

268
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,000
and then you have something 
called unit price scale 

269
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,450
which is very important right 
because the this is very important 

270
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,300
so this is a fractional unit price round off to  

271
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,500
many decimal places right so this two here  

272
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,400
so that's a bit that's, you can change it 
if you wanted to change it 

273
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,700
then you have something called 
by default the legacy calculator 

274
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,350
so this enable the 
salesforce CPQ legacy calculator  

275
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,700
but you have to understand one thing  

276
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,900
salesforce CPQ no longer offer support  

277
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,900
for this version of the calculator 
so it's better to untick 

278
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,200
yeah, so.... 

279
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,500
now you must be wondering 
oh this is too much right 

280
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
i understand 
we haven't touched detail  

281
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,800
in in detail about pricing 

282
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,900
about discounting model calculation  

283
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,900
we're gonna get there but 

284
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,750
just wanted to understand that 
we have these settings in place  

285
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,250
so it will make you  

286
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,750
use CPQ in, in a much informed way right 

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,600
then we have very important 
thing, enable quick calculate  

288
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,180
so this is this one this boy here 

289
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,900
so when you tick this option right  

290
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,250
it actually um so  

291
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,250
i'll tell you one thing what 
does this do right in simple terms  

292
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,600
so this functionality right 

293
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,500
this specific functionality it 
actually improves your code calculation time 


294
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,850
and how does that do that  

295
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,300
so it's pretty simple 

296
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,150
it disables three function, uh features  

297
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,700
one is the price rule 

298
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,900
in quote line formula field 

299
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,900
that depends upon the parent relationship 

300
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,200
and displaying role-up summary fields 

301
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,600
in the quote line  editor so  

302
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,650
if you wanted to use this 

303
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,350
those three things will be disabled 

304
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,700
price rules, quote line formula fields  

305
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,500
displaying roll-up summary fields 
in the quote line editor  

306
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,100
so this is how it improves the 

307
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,716
the the calculation time right  

308
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:25,550
so now you must be wondering oh there's  

309
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,360
different things so  

310
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,600
i mean for now this is all i think 
you should pay attention to it 

311
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
i know the subscriptions and renew renewal 

312
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,300
so if you if you are if you you know go and  

313
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,700
buy like it's like in a magazine right  

314
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,050
you buy for 12 months subscription 

315
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,600
so i get order renewed after 12 months so  

316
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,400
so yeah so different options comes into places 

317
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,850
this is a little bit more to talk about it 

318
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,000
so i'm not going to talk about today because  

319
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,150
unfortunately i'm already getting tired  

320
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,350
so  i will stop it right here now 

321 
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,800
and in the next episode 

322
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,700
hopefully tomorrow, day after tomorrow 

323
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,400
i will cover the remaining part of it right 

324
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,050
sounds good i hope 

325 
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,550
so yeah i mean 

326
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,450
from exam point of view this is important 

327
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,050
so one thing i always tell right 

328
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,650
when i teach people certification 

329
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,250
my main goal is not to you know teach you guys 

330
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,600
just to clear the certification 
but to enjoy the journey 

331
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,000
understand the product very well 

332
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and become a better consultant or an architect 

333
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,250
right that's all my intention is all about 

334
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,600
right so that being said 

335
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:30,600
i hope you guys have an  amazing  wednesday  anyway
