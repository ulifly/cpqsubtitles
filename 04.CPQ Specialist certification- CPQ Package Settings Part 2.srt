1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,149
good everyone 

2
00:00:01,149 --> 00:00:02,850
i hope you guys have an amazing day 

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,550
so in the last episode i spoke about 

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,400
CPQ configuration package settings 

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,850
i did  mention about the few tabs  

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,450
the documents groups and  

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,550
and plug-ins so, what i'm gonna do today, right 

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,500
i'm not gonna cover everything 

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,450
because it's not really required 

10
 00:00:22,450 -->  00:00:24,050
for you to know at this stage  

11
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,150
so i will talk about few aspects of it, right 

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,650
so for instance 

13
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,450
let's look at the line editor 

14
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,650
and we're going to talk about 

15
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,750
the options which is tick by default 

16
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,250
like you know visualize product hierarchy 

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,150
preserve bundle structure 

15
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,450
keep bundle together  

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,050
enable multi-line delete right 

17
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,800
so multi-line delete 

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,900
okay so that's a  pretty simple option right 

19
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,450
so if you  enable that option 

20
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,550  
so what that will do  

21
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,400 
it will help the sales rep 

22
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,200 
to multiselect quote lines 

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,050 
and then delete it 

24
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,350 
that's pretty much it 

25
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,100 
so you know you can select multiple lines 

26
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,600 
and then you can delete, okay  

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,250 
and then we have something called 
visual product hierarchy 

28
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,250 
which is pretty simple  

29
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,800 
so it will intend the 
components of the bundle together 

30
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,600 
so, which also includes your nested bundles  

31
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,100 
so  you know this feature right 

32
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,250 
this is a pretty important feature 

33
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,550 
it will actually makes your bundle easier to read 

34
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,350 
especially if they have 
many product options, right

35
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,950 
um so that's one thing right so that's  

36
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,850 
that's why it's ticked by default 

37
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,350 
then we have preserve bundle structure  

38
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,050 
so, so it will display bundles products options 

39
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,750 
in the same order in the renewable quotes 

40
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,250 
right, so now you must be wondering um  

41
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,450 
that doesn't make sense so, 

42
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,850 
this  feature is useful right in simple terms  

43
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,600 
if you organize your bundles 

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,690 
with important or frequently 

45
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,350 
edited product options at the beginning of the bundle  

46
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,650 
that's pretty much it right 

47
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,750 
okay and keep the bundle together 

48
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,500 
that's that's pretty simple right 

49
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500 
when you drag and drop a bundle 

50
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,050 
parent to a different locations  

51
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,150 
in a quote line editor 

53
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,850 
Salesforce CPQ moves it's component to the 
new  quote line positions as well 

54
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,100 
so that's pretty much it  

55
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,150 
excuse me! 

56
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,550
so now let's look at the um  

57
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,450
the subscriptions and renewals 

58
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,850
i don't want to talk much about 
the subscriptions and renewals  

59
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,750
because the reason why i don't want to talk  

60
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,050
because there's not much we're 
going to talk about at this stage  

61
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,500
so, and the only thing i would

62
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,450
in general would love to uh talk about  

63
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,600
is that the use of the legacy 

64
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,300
amend and the renewal service 

65
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,800
that this one  

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,450
so you know in summer 19 or later right  

67
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,450
the scale amendment  

68
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:56,350
and amendment and renewable service, you know 

69
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,650
just, just got enabled by default 

70
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,550
so  it's it's a new service right 

71
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,350
so it offers you know 
improved support of amendment  

72
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,650
and renewable actions of contracts 

73
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,450
with  large volume of you know the related  records  

74
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,950
right now 

75
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,300
to revert to the previous you know uh  

76
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,350
service functionality so we tick this one 

77
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,150
so that's pretty much it says

78
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,450
continue using legacy contract service, so  

79
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,450
if you wanted to use the old legacy 

80
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,550
renew service then tick this by default 

81
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,150
you know, when you install the CPQ package 

82
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,200
it comes ticked 

83
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,800
so if you wanted to use the old service
keep on doing it that's fine  

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,450
like i said it's based on your business requirement  

85
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,850
so we're going to talk about it later  

86
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,050
CPQ is a vast topic right 

87
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,550
so we will be covering different aspects of it 

88
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,150
and as we uncover different you know parts of CPQ

89
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,300
we will be revisiting some  
of the package settings 

90
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,950
so don't worry we will cover again  

91
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,750
okay so i just want to mention a couple of them 

92
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,850
so like disable initial quote sync  

93
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,250
by default when a salesforce rep 

94
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,800
sales trip right, creates the first quote 

95
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,450
from an opportunity salesforce CPQ 

96
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,100
creates quotes lines for each of the opportunities  

97
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,250
opportunity product so if you tick this, right 

98
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,300
so if i make this tick, right 

99
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,650
what will happen is  

100
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,050
salesforce CPQ

101
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,500
does not create quote line 
for this opportunity products  

101
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,950
that's pretty much it,  right  

102
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,250
the same goes for the disable quote 

103
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,550
contact defaulting 

104
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,500
so when the sales reps 
makes a quote from an opportunity  

105
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,550
the quote doesn't inherit its 
primary contact from the opportunity, right

106
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,000
the  sales rep or  you know whoever is 

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,150
enters the quote primary contact in um instantly  

108
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,550
so um deletions it's pretty simple 

109
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,200
you know you can delete product 
options from the prior quotes

110
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,800
so that's what it is  

111
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,850
and so as you can see that 

112
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,500
we have an option called allow multiple orders 

113
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
so you know  your sales rep can split  

114
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,050
a quote, quote lines into 
multiple orders right  

115
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,350
obviously you can only do using CPQ, right 

116
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,650
you can't do without CPQ so that's  

117
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,500
the and if you tick this 
you can do the multiple orders  

118
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,100
so yeah i mean that's pretty much 
i wanted to talk about

119
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,900
in today's episode 

120
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,000
i mean, i do  understand that you must be thinking 

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,700
oh  you've got a lot of options here 

122
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,800
but you don't have to know at this stage 

123
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,550
trust me you don't have to know at this stage  

124
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,600
you're at the beginning stage of CPQ

125
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,350
i don't want it to overwhelm you 
guys with too many options 

126
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,100
so whatever i've covered for now 
that's good enough for  

127
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,900
us to move forward 

128
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,550
and as we you know progress through the quotes

129
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,200
we might revisit these options again, right 

130
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,950
so that's pretty much 
i wanted to cover in this episode 

131
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,600
as you can see that my 
voice is still a bit clunky 

132
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,550
i mean, i'm still recovering from cough 

133 
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,000
i tell you guys cough is 
the worst thing to get, right 

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
if it's the first thing to come in and the last  

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,150
thing to move right leave your body so  

136
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,350
yeah i mean i've been battling 
with this cough for like  

137
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,850
almost two and a half weeks now 
ever since i got that  

138
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,150
influenza right so but  

139
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,200
i think i'm getting better so yeah 

140
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
so that's that being said 

141
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,200
i hope you guys have an amazing day, adios
