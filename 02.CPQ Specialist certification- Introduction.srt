01
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,450
good everyone, i hope you guys have an amazing day 

02
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,829
so today i want to briefly touch on what CPQ is all about  

03
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:09,829
we're going to register for an org  

04
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,709
and i'm going to talk about a licensing  aspect as well 

05
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:16,310
right, the reason why i wanted to mention about the licensing aspect

06
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,349
i remember someone recently pointed out to me  

07
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:25,910
that you know whenever i talk about a functionality, 
it's good to talk about the licensing aspect 

08
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,000
so i like, yeah fair enough that's a valid point

09
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,109
so the first thing first right

10
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,830
i just wanted to, you know in the last episode i, i mentioned 

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,790
about the certification and exam guide 

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:46,549
so, today i will talk about, what exactly CPQ is all  about 

13
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:48,950
why do you need CPQ, right 

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,189
we'll talk about a fictitious scenario 

15
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:57,110
and we'll create an org, 
and yeah, and probably create a quote

16
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,000
so that's pretty  much i'm gonna cover today   

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,630
all right, so what is CPQ right 

18
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,910
CPQ stand for three things one is the C, P, and Q right 

19
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,450
so C stand for configure 
P stand for price 
and the Q stand for quote right 

20
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,350
the C... when we talk about configure it's like  

21
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,350
you pick out what they will buy i mean your customer will buy  

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,800
and P is for price it just, 
you know it's the product price obviously, right

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,200
and the Q is for quote, that's the quote 
which you normally send to the  customer

24
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:37,879
now, you must be wondering right, 
what the heck is the quote, right  

25
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:40,479
so, to explain that  

26
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:48,179
you know, i just have to give you a scenario but,  
in saying that i will talk about briefly  

27
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:50,479
about what quote is about 

28
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,179
right so, say for instance you have a customer 

29
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,179
okay, the customer comes to you and say, i wanted a quote

30
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,179
now, if you're not sure what a quote is you must be 
wondering what the heck the customer is asking 

31
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:03,879
but most likely, that's not the case but in general i'm  saying  

32
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:11,879
so what quote is about, they wanted to know 
the details about a potential purchase  

33
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:17,149
right, such as what they will be getting
and how much they will be paying

34
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:21,449
and also the terms and conditions, 
so that's in a nutshell a quote is all about, okay 

35
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:25,049
the product is the products you add  

36
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:28,470
example for instance customer wants to buy  

37
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,670
you know  the 10, you know 10 
bottles of beers so that's a product 

38
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,270
so you categorize you can, products can be bundled  

39
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,670
that's a different thing

40
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,670
so menti... talk about a bit, and we have the price you know the price  

41
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,070
the price associated with the product  

42
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:49,048
right so, yeah so this is in a nutshell the CPQ is about 

43
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:51,048
but that's that's not enough yet 

44
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:53,448
so because i, i do understand that you must be thinking 

45
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:56,348
that but this information means nothing to me right 

46
00:02:56,348 --> 00:02:59,648
so if i'm a consultant, or so for instance if i'm a company 

47
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:04,148
i... you know i use salesforce but 
you know, why should i go for CPQ

48
00:03:04,148 --> 00:03:06,348
when we have everything else in place  

49
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:08,948
okay, so i'll give a scenario  

50
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:11,988
so for instance i run a brewing  company okay 

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,888
so we brew different beers like IPAs stouts, lagers, right 

52
00:03:17,988 --> 00:03:21,488
now, we have a few customers so for instance 

53
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:25,388
this is a fictional company right,
so the company based in Wellington
 
54
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,688
so we got a few customers, say for instance customers from Oakland

55
00:03:28,988 --> 00:03:32,688
customers from wellington, customers from, crashes, customers from Australia

56
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:35,588
like for instance Melbourne um or Sydney right 

57
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:39,984
now, there are some customers 
which are long-term customers 

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,288
like australian customers they often buy in bulk 

59
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:44,465
they buy a lot of things 

60
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:50,005
so, based on that, you know if 
we give a different price to them it's like a discount  

61
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:56,585
and you know the same product cost different in Australia 
because of the currency difference, right  

62
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,555
now, so what what happened right, 
initially you know as a company  

63
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:07,555
we builds the product pricing information 
in a separate system

64
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:11,000
which is often accessed by...

65
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,200
the team who looks after the pricing information

66
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,775
unfortunately the sales team 
do not have access to the system 

67
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:23,912
so what normally happens is,
when the sales guy requests for an information 

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,478
the admin of their pricing system often

69
00:04:27,578 --> 00:04:31,400
generate a pdf and send to the, 
to the sales guy 

70
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,700
or you can do, also do excel documentation 

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,000
which is fine

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,700
now, we hit a snag eventually  

73
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,200
where you know, there were three sales guys,
new sales guy we hired recently

74
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:52,000
and we have to, you know offer 
different pricing to a brewery from Sydney 

75
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,100
different pricing from brewery uh from Oakland 

76
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,650
as and as well as a brewing from Christchurch  

77
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,050
now, uh one of the sales guys reached out to  

78
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,700
the pricing team and say 
hey i'm looking  for the pricing for IPA's 

79
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:15,100
say the customer requesting for like 
you know 800 bottles of IPA beers 

80
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,500
so, and i'm planning to give discount so 
can you send me the updated pricing information?

81
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,400
so you know they decided okay 

82
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,600
the, the pricing team sent the information 
in the form of pdf, the sales team is happy 

83
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,099
now, for whatever reason right 

84
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,540
the pricing team has updated the price on some beers  

85
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,500
so, now what happened?

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,500
after they updated, 

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,500
the sales guy who 
requested for the pdf was a week ago 

88
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
didn't get the latest  copy of a pdf 

89
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,600
right, so obviously he was working the old copy  

90
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,600
and the other two sales members 

91 
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,500
right, they got the latest copy  

92
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,100
now, obviously you know, right the salespeople 

93
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,100

not necessarily have to talk  to each other right 

94
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,850
it's like if you're a salesperson 

95
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,900
you obviously won't go and ask 
hey what's your pricing model 

96
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,250
what's  your pricing all right
obviously don't do that 

97
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,250
so the so, as a matter of fact to keep the story short 

98
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,750
the first salesperson got that outdated information  

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,200
and he created a quote and 
send the quote to the customer with an old

100
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,600
with a different pricing model 

101
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
and when the customer received the  information customers like 

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,050
hey, this is not what i've been told 

103
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,050
i've been told a different pricing model 

104
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,050
i discussed just now with the  

105
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,750
with the senior executive from 
your brewing company and they said 

106
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,800
you'll be getting a different pricing model 
and you guys send me entirely different one what we agreed on

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and the sales guy's like, oh that's crap 
we don't have the latest information 

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,750
and  the sales guy go back to the pricing team 

109
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,950
and say hey can you send me the latest pdf please 

110
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,700
so the guy, the team sent him the latest PDF and see all totally different pricing model 

111
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,600
so, now you see the discrepancy right 

112
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,250
and, now this has caused 
a frustration among your customer 

113
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,300
and the customer started to think 
these guys are, are they trying to cheat me?

114
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,600
or they're trying to fool me?,  
because they said something to me 

115 
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,800
they said very different information  

116
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,250
when i spoke to one of their account executive 
on the phone, now they're sending me a different quote 

117
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:31,100
it just seems pretty shady it's, so you know, 
that can cause a frustration among the customer 

118
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,600
now imagine, that's one thing  

119
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,550
and another thing, you know we 
have a quote creating system  

120
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,600
which is you know in a different system again

121
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,500
so, the customer has to, so the sales team 
has to reload the information 

122
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,650
into the new system, and then generate the quote, right 

123
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,000
so, it's like a duplicate of information 
that's floating around 

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,700
and also there's a risk that the sales team  

125
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,750
may not have the updated pricing 
information on a product 

126
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:07,000
so, and if you look at it  from us, 
from a thousand feet above right 

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,650
you might see oh it's a very 
simple problem to have 

128
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,500
but from a customer perspective
it's a misleading information  

129
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
and also from a business reputation point of view 

130
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,110
it's a big thing to, to have  

131
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,600
i mean, or i mean, i would say  
it's the worst thing to have 

132
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,600
you know, when the customer 
started getting annoyed right 

133
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,400
because you know if customer, 
if a customer get annoyed 

134
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,700
they might go and say to another client 
hey i don't trust that brewing company 

135
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,900
because  they tell something on the phone 

136
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,900
and when they send out the quote they, 
they try to cheat you with the wrong quote

137
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,098
so, to solve that problem, right

138
00:08:43,598 --> 00:08:48,700
we have something called CPQ right,
CPQ is integrated with the salesforce 

139
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,850
you don't have to use different system  

140
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,850
data resides in the salesforce 

141
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,130
so you know people with the right access can  
access the information from the same data source 

142
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,750
which is from a salesforce object 

143
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,400
so you see how cool is that, right  

144
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,750
and already we're using ourselves for so, 
you know so with an extra license 

145
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,950
it just worked wonders for us,
and also it saves the thrust 

146
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,200
it saves a lot of sales time, sales rep time

147
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,600
to go and  request you know the 
pdf or excel from a pricing team 

148
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,500
so they don't have to do that anymore 
they just can access everything from a single  

149
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,850
store, or in other words from a single software right 

150
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,100
from a salesforce, so that's one advantage 

151
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,600
now that's a very major advantage though right 
because salesforce offers a lot of things 

152
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,700
in when it comes to CPQ  

153
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,360
you know, we talk about quotes, 
we talk  about products 

154
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
just now mentioned, we talk about the prices  

155
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,700
you know, we can generate the quotes in a pdf form 

156
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,400
and also, you can also, do the contracts and renewals 
if you have a subscription-based model 

157
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,900
we're going to talk about everything in detail 

158
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,500
when it reached the stage, 
but today just an overview, so 

159
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,100
i hope this is clear when 
i try to explain from a business point of view  

160
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,450
my apologies if, if the example 
looks a bit shady 

161
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,050
but you know, 
i think beer example is pretty cool 

162
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:16,175
right, because obviously customers try 
to buy a lot of beers from a brewery 

163
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:19,000
so obviously they're interested 
to have, to get the quote 

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,750
right to see like if i buy 800 
so what's the discount will be like  

165
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,200
what's the pricing right, so they wanted 
to get that information before

166
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,600
you know, the opportunity 
get converted into an order 

167
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,100
right so, it is a very streamlined process 

168
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,800
when, when you talk about CPQ

168
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,500
now, CPQ like i said it's not free okay  

169
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,500
so obviously if you have a 
salesforce org, you have to buy  

170
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
you have to pay for the license okay  

171
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,700
so for our demo what i'm going to do 
i will register for an org  

172
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,500
so as you can see the screen, on the screen right  

173
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,900
so now, if you look at the pricing information 
right, it's all online 

174
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,200
so, okay i'm not interested in chatting right  

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,050
so CPQ right 75 bucks USD 

176
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,350
you're not talking about new zealand dollars 
you're not talking about australian money

177
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,200
you're talking about american dollars, right  

178
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,250
yeah, i mean i don't want to get 
into the currency argument 

179
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,250
this is what it is, 
it's an american company

180
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,200 
so american money, right 
pretty sweet

181
00:11:27,200  --> 00:11:30,200
all right, so configure 
price and quote software right 

182
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,800
you get it for 75 bucks  
per user and paid monthly, right  

183
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,300
then you have CPQ plus 

184
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,050
you can configure, price and, quote software 
with increased process control and automation 

185
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,700
so, this is another thing 

186
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,200
and then you have CPQ billing and growth 

187
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,800
so which is you have to request a quote 

188
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,900
and create quote to cash...  cash solution 
 
189 
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,700
this is a, this most companies might be interested in this 

190
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,900
so for that you have to contact salesforce, right  

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,400
so now if you look at the, the functionality right 

192
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,120
a lot of things quote to cash offers 

193
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,520
like configure, pricing, quoting 
which is pretty common to all the... 

194
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,200
the model licensing options we have  

195
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,800
enhanced products, catalogs and price book,
because price book is very important  

196
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,350
and i believe you know, if you are a small brewery and... 

197
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,250
i will encourage you to start with the basic 

198
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,350
to see if it really fits the requirement 

199
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,350
uh that's the reason why we have a 
trailhead org, you can, you can you know 

200
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,150
go and fiddle with it to see 
if it really meets your requirement 

201
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,050
so, these two options will 
pretty much do the job for you  

202
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:44,450
in saying that, you might also need 
advanced approval and order management 

203
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,300
so you might need to go for CPQ plus 

204
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,300
or if you also might need usage-based pricing 

205
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,700
so you might CPQ plus a it's a great option  

206
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,050
but if you're after invoicing and revenue schedules 

207
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,400
then you might have to go for, 
along with all the other options we discuss 

208
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,000
then you have to go for CPQ & billing growth  

209
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,150
that in saying so, if you're after complex revenue reporting 

210
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,150
automated payments in a location 
then you have to go for CPQ & billing plus 

211
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,990
and for that you have to request a quote  

212
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,500
so that's in a nutshell 
about the licensing model, all right 

213
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,900
i hope that's clear i don't want 
to miss out the licensing part 

214
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,350
just to make you guys understand  
it's not a free stuff to use  

215
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,500
so you have to pay for it right 

216
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,500 
so  that's cool all right 

217
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,900 
now how to register for an org right

218
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,750 
obviously you know, i assume 
that you guys are preparing for certification 

219
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,000 
so most of the students or even if you're working  

220
00:13:39,000  --> 00:13:42,300 
you know in CPQ space you might want to try it out yourself 

221
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,100 
it's it's good to have an org ready 
so that you guys can practice 

222
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,400 
which is fantastic 
so what do you have to do, right 

223
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,600 
go to this place called...
i'll put the link in the description below so don't worry 

224
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,300 
don't stress yourself for you know, 
to write it down, don't worry about it 

225
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,900 
i'll put the link in the description 

226
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,900 
so go to this link you know 

227
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,200 
trailhead.salesforce.com, CPQ trail 

228
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,650 
so you just fill in the details 

229
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,900 
it's just like any other org
registration which you've done before  

230
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,200 
pretty simple, pretty consistent,
it's not a rocket science right 

231
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,600 
nothing fancy here, all right 

232
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,400 
so once you fill in you'll get an email 
you, you click on to verify your account  

233
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,600 
enter your password 
you're good to go, you're in an org 

234
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,900 
so i'm in org, so most likely  

235
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,600 
what happens you will not see the CPQ, 
when you log into your ORG  

236
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,250 
so if you don't see it  

237
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,900 
you might see something else so 
what you can do, go to this tic tac toe icon 

238
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,350 
and you will see CPQ, Salesforce CPQ org  

239
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,250 
okay so select that and you 
will get these options here 

240
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,050 
you get opportunities which is pretty important 

241
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:52,650 
obviously when we talk about CPQ 
we talk about opportunities a lot, right  

242
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,450 
so you create a quote, 
i'll show you how to do that 

243
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,550 
it's very simple 

244
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:02,350 
then you have orders, how you create an order, 
we have products obviously 

245
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,350 
CPQ is incomplete without a product 

246
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,850
then your product rules different 
products rules that comes into place  

247
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,400
how to configure it, i will talk about it 
when we reach to that stage 

248
00:15:12,400 -->  00:15:18,600
but for now just, just you know,
don't worry about it okay for now 

249
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,600
then we have pricing rules so 
different pricing rules right 

250
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,400
summary variables, 
then you have more options like quote terms  

251
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,200
you know quote templates 

252
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,350
we'll look at  all of these things right 

253
00:15:31,350 -->  00:15:33,950
because you know the certification 
covers a lot of things  

354
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,900
so today is just an introduction  

355
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,350
okay, so go to opportunity 

356
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,750
i mean, i can pick any 
opportunities i want right 

357
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,350
so i'll choose this opportunity, 
all opportunity  


358
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,250
a camera for marketing team right,
whatever that is  

359
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,050
okay, you already have a quote right 
and this is a primary quote 

360
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,630
so you can only have 
one primary quote for opportunity  

361
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,630
right remember that 

362 
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:03,530
now how to create a quote right, 
now you must be thinking okay

363
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,950
so... what we can do?

364
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,650
you can go to new so, 
i'll start fresh with the, with the new... 

364
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,550
opportunity, let's say which one has a...

365
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,790
it, maybe it doesn't have one  

366
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,090
that's just support for  

367
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,090
all right so you know what

367
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:29,390
we're just gonna,
delete this one  

368
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,750
don't care  

369
00:16:32,450 -->  00:16:34,450
all right so you will get something like this 

370
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,940
when you create a new opportunity, right 
opportunity can contain... 

371
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:43,220
many quotes right, so, now so, you so 

372 
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,380
most of the things just, 
you will  not find this configuration 

373

00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,450
if you are using a normal developer org 

374
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,050
because, this is a CPQ org 

375
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,450
so that's why you can see quotes

376
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,650
you can see contracts 
you can see renewable contracts 

377
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:00,450
you can see different stuff right  

378
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,350
all right so i'm going to show you 
how to create a quote 

379
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,400
so, quote is like a pdf document 
you send out to your customer  

380
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
pretty simple 

381
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,850
it contains information about 
the product, pricing, terms of agreement 

382
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,400
nothing fancy, right  

383
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,150
okay so, go to quote here, and go to new  

384
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,600
so we'll say buy some, what um...

385
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,900
so if i wanted to make primary,
just make a primary  

386
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,300
select this checkbox to designate 
this quote as a primary 

387
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,900
one on the opportunity  

388
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,400
and sync quote line with 
the opportunity line item 

389
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,000
so it will sync your quote line  

390
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,500
with an opportunity line items,
just remember that, right 

391
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,400
so for now it's all right
i'm, i'm happy with that 

392
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,100
so obviously you search an opportunity  

393
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,600
uh which one is the right, okay  

394
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,900
i will say okay, desktop computers 
for supporting agents  

395
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,500
accounts i'm just going to 
choose the Dave account  

396
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,900
Dave Muller and sales rep 

397
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,150
i honestly, okay i choose my name  

398
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,450
why not right

399
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,550
and i'm not really concerned 
about any of the stuff at this stage 

400
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,450
because we  will talk about it  

401
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,450
but today's the main idea is to just to show you 

402
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,500
how simple is to create a quote  

403
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,300
okay so, that's all we are focusing on today  

404
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,500
click on save  

405
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,400
it's not rocket science guys right i mean 

406
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,600
there's nothing complicated about it  

407
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,250
it's just, you have to understand the  concept 

408
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,950
why you have to do it, right  

409
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,150
so that's the main thing, 
because you will be  

410
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,750
working as a consultant 
you have to explain to the customer 

411
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,950
why they should go for CPQ 
if you come and tell me, right  

412
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,700
it does the quote,
it does the product line 

413
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,150
i said, well we have our own  
in-house software which does that very well  

414
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,695
so you have to, 
as a consultant here, right 

415
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:45,600
you have to understand the pros and cons 

416
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,950
and you have to compare their software  

417
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,350
and then come up with you know your  

418
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,050
reasoning you know to suggest customer  

491
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,880
that, hey go for CPQ 

492
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,480
and that's why you have to 
have full understanding  

493
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,100
about the licensing model  

494
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,400
pricing it's very important 

495
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
okay so, edit lines 

496
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,800
right, so i'm going to go to edit lines 

497
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
here we're going to add quote

498
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,700
products i'm going to add 
a few a couple of products right  

499
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,400
so add products,
so you can add a group  

500
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,300
but i'm just adding products 
that's simple  

501
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,150
okay so what i'm going to do?... 

502
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,150
notebook, hopefully i have some  

503
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,850
or no, computer  

504
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,900
okay i'm just going to choose the  
desktop computer that's pretty much cool

505
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,900
i'm just going to select it  

506
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,500
and, all right so  

507
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,800
when you choose the 
desktop computer, right 

508
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,700
see what, it do it will show you 
all of these prices right

509
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,120
it's like a product bundle, okay  

510
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,600
so, i'll show you  

511
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,100
look at that 

512
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,300
and, okay so all i wanted was a  

513
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,950
a desktop computer

514
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,000
but along with the desktop computer 

515
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,200
it says hey do you want  

516
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,850
you know the cpu, the ram, 
the keyboard, the mouse 


517
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,950
it comes as a bundle 
it's a product bundle 

518
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,950
so, a product bundle contains 

519
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,700
say, in simple terms, like keyboard 

520
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,800
sorry, a computer, 
computer desktop will include  

521
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,350
mouse, keyboard, maybe webcam 

522
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,050
you know  

523
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,700
so these all can be sold as a bundle, right 


524
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,500
it's just a one product bundle 

525
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,380
so, so this is a desktop computer 

526
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,000
and it just sold us, just one bundle 

527
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,650
that all of this stuff here  

528
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,550
okay so, let's say 
i wanted to add another product 

529
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,080
just to give you an idea  

530
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,750
okay so let's say i will add another one  

531
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,150
so i'll just add another mouse 

532
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,300
let's say i wanted to add another mouse right 

533
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,450
i choose this mouse and i say select, right

534
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,050
all right, so it's added by itself right  

535
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,450
i mean, because it doesn't come as a bundle 

536
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,450
because you know, 
yes it is a part of a computer 

537
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,300
but, when you buy a mouse 

538
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,500
nobody asks you, hey do you want 
to buy a computer laptop with it  

539
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,200
it doesn't work right 

540
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,400
so when you buy a laptop 

541
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,300
or when you buy a desktop computer

542
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,950
they often ask hey do you want a mouse,
do you want a keyboard

543
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,650
right, if you if you buy the chassis right  

544
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,650
i mean i'm not sure if many people 

545
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,250
uses the desktop computer today but  

546
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,700
let's say for the sake of 
argument people do, right 

547
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,150
so this is how you know, the bundles are configured 

548
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,300
i hope the explanation is clear because 

549
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,850
i wanted to make you guys understand right 

550
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,750
you know, say a customer comes 
to you and request the quote 

551
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,650
so you know, these are the things 
that you include as a quote

552
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,550
and the customer will want to know 
what they're going to get 

553
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,950
and what the price will be like  
what's the terms and conditions  

554
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,450
fantastic right  

555
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,650
save  

556
00:22:01,00 --> 00:22:02,850
all right now  

557
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,450
you can preview the document 

558
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:09,650
so, so you'll see 
how the document will look like 

559
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,550
and how you're going 
to send to the customer so 

560
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,750
this is how you're 
going to send to the customer 

561
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,350
so there's a sales person

562 
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,250  
description i mean  

563
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,350  
for now it's fine 

564
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,350 
and the terms and  condition 

565
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,050 
this is what you're going 
to send to the customer  

566
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,050 
and the customer 
will be happy with it 

567
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,400 
so you create an order  

568
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,850 
and you know  
you ship the stuff to the customer 

569
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:33,050 
so that's how in simple terms 
the things goes behind the scene  

570
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,400 
as you can see it's pretty simple 

571
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,650 
it's pretty handy you,
i don't have to go to  

572
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,150 
you know different
team to request  

573
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,250 
for a price 

574
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,750 
of a product, 
i don't have to go anywhere 

575
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,800 
you know outside this  
specific software 

576
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,400 
to you know look for...

577
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,400 
you know, different products 

578
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,850 
right, so i don't have to look for a different  

579
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,000 
software to look for opportunity to link  to 

580
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,250 
so it's all in one place 
it's all a part of a single software 

581
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,750 
that's advantage Salesforce brings 

582
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,000 
so this is  why i believe 
that CPQ is very important  

583
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,750 
so even the customers
are using their in-house  

584
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,550 
just one, one thing i wanted to highly  

585
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,700 
recommend you guys, 
just do not suggest CPQ 

586
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,300
without understanding their  
in-house system right 

587
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,050
i have seen consultants 

588
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,050
you know especially, not just in CPQ 

589
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,550
they say hey, can you go 
and take this one 

590
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,850
can you go and take that one 

591
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,750
if i'm a customer i will say, well  

592
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,850
have you even seen 
what we have in house  

593
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,650
first of all right 

594
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,350
so if you're a consultant 

595
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,300
or you know specialist  
whatever you call yourself 

596
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,750
it becomes your responsibility 
to understand first of all 

597
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,550
the problem the customer is facing 

598
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,250
then you propose a solution 

599
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,750
don't propose a solution first 

600
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,750 
and then try to understand the solution 

601
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,700
that's a very bad way to do that 

602
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,150
you might find it funny 

603
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,000
but i've seen people doing that as well  

604
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,700
so so that's pretty much i wanted to...  

605
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,350
talk about in today's episode 

606
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,900
i hope you  guys enjoyed it  

607
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,150
if you have any questions 

608
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,000
please feel free to ask me anytime right 

609
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,889
have a great day, adios
